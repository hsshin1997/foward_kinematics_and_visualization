This is README file for running the forward kinematics and visualization code. 

See docs for the detailed manual and structure of the code. 

To run the code, go to examples and selecte the one you want to run. In the folder there must be at least four files:
1. MAIN.m --> main forward kinematics code
2. Link Mass Data
3. Link Length
4. DH Parameters

Joint variable file is optional. If you want to animate your result, you must have one. 

The output of the code will be saved to the subfolder you are working on. 

If you want to make new example, create the subfolder in the example folder. Then add the files mentioned above according to your need.
